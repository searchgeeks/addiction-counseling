By treating the whole person, we help clients build healthier coping skills, emotional balance, and confidence in their ability to move forward.</p><div class="content-image-below"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://sgs2024seo.blob.core.windows.net/addiction-counseling/img/alcoholaddictioncounseling.jpg"></div> <p data-end="2320" data-start="1731">We offer Addiction Treatment Services in Hawthorne, NJ that are personalized to each individual&rsquo;s goals and circumstances.

    <p>Roland is a long time friend. I can truly say this is his passion as well as his gifting. He is very knowledgeable, yet maintains a compassionate approach to his work and those he serves. He is so easy to talk to. I have always felt confident in referring loved ones to him. He has years of experience, and can provide care through that broad lense. He is able to address the mental, physical, and spiritual needs of those he serves. 10/10 recommend!</p>
