Whether someone is struggling with alcohol, drugs, gambling, or behavioral addictions, our Addiction Counseling services focus on understanding the root causes of addiction rather than simply managing surface-level behaviors.</p> <p data-end="1729" data-start="1114">Our Addiction Recovery Counseling approach recognizes that recovery is not the same for everyone. Some individuals may need structured support for substance use, while others seek help for behavioral addictions such as gambling or compulsive habits. Many clients also experience anxiety, depression, stress, or unresolved trauma alongside addiction, which is why our counseling services address both mental health and addictive behaviors together. By treating the whole person, we help clients build healthier coping skills, emotional balance, and confidence in their ability to move forward.</p><div class="content-image-below"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://sgs2024seo.blob.core.windows.net/addiction-counseling/img/alcoholaddictioncounseling.jpg"></div> <p data-end="2320" data-start="1731">We offer Addiction Counseling in Hawthorne, NJ that are personalized to each individual&rsquo;s goals and circumstances.

We also provide counseling for individuals facing co-occurring mental health challenges, ensuring that emotional well-being is not overlooked during recovery. By addressing anxiety, depression, and emotional stress alongside addiction, we help reduce the risk of relapse and support more sustainable progress over time.

    <p>Roland is a long time friend. I can truly say this is his passion as well as his gifting. He is very knowledgeable, yet maintains a compassionate approach to his work and those he serves. He is so easy to talk to. I have always felt confident in referring loved ones to him. He has years of experience, and can provide care through that broad lense. He is able to address the mental, physical, and spiritual needs of those he serves. 10/10 recommend!</p>
